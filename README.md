# Movie-Recommendation
This project uses "MovieLens 1M Dataset" which contain 1,000,209 anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies 
made by 6,040 MovieLens users who joined MovieLens in 2000. I have used pandas, numpy, warnings, matplotlib and seaborn libraries of python in this project.
Using these libraries and dataset I've created a basic movie recommendation system that recommends movies to the user based on the movie of the user's choice.
